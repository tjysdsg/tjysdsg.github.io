Jiyang Tang

I'm a Data Science student at [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/about). I'm a member of
[SMIIP Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/2019/08/10/welcome) led by my advisor
[Professor Ming Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/MingLi).

My research focus is **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** and **Computer Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT)** using
end-to-end methods.

I also have interests in programming languages, compilers, and game engines.

[My CV](assets/cv.pdf)

# Publications

- End-to-End Mandarin Tone Classification with Short Term Context Information, accepted by APSIPA ASC 2021

# Projects

## CAPT

- [Espnet fork](https://github.com/tjysdsg/espnet) for end-to-end mispronunciation detection
- Implementation of
  [Mispronunciation Detection and Correction via Discrete Acoustic Units](https://github.com/tjysdsg/DAU-MD)
- [Kaldi fork](https://github.com/tjysdsg/kaldi) for CAPT using Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP)
- Computer Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) mobile app (server backend is not open source) called
  [hippo](https://github.com/tjysdsg/hippo)
- Standard Mandarin acoustic model [training script](https://github.com/tjysdsg/std-mandarin-kaldi).
  The model is used for calculating GOP
- Mandarin Tone Classification [experiments](https://github.com/tjysdsg/tone_classifier)
- Phone-level force alignment [scripts](https://github.com/tjysdsg/kaldi-align-to-phones) using Kaldi
- Phone-level force alignment [scripts](https://github.com/tjysdsg/aidatatang_force_align) used for my paper
 
## Other

- Hand-written [speech recognition system](https://github.com/tjysdsg/speech-recognition) for English pronunciation
  of digits using Python+Numpy
- Compiler for my own programming language [tan](https://github.com/tjysdsg/tan)
- [Dance style classifier](https://github.com/tjysdsg/dance-classifier)
- [Scripts and documentation](https://github.com/tjysdsg/birds) for Chinese endemic bird image dataset
- [Prebuilt LLVM and Clang libraries](https://github.com/tjysdsg/llvm-build)
- [Prebuilt Openpose](https://github.com/tjysdsg/openpose-built)
- ... and many other repos [here](https://github.com/tjysdsg?tab=repositories). Unfortunately, many of my current
  projects are not open source
