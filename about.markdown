Jiyang Tang

I am a first year master student at Carnegie Mellon University, expected to obtain [Master of Science in Intelligent
Information Systems](https://miis.cs.cmu.edu/) degree in 2024.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Data Science at [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/about) in
May 2022.

I am advised by [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe) and working
on [Espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) for my directed study.
