Jiyang Tang

I'm a Data Science student at [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/about). I'm a member of
[SMIIP Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/2019/08/10/welcome) led by my advisor
[Professor Ming Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/MingLi).

I focus on **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** and **Computer Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT)**.

I also have interests in programming languages, compilers, and game engines.
