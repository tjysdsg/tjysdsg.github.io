# Removing a file from last Git commit

## Purposes
- Remove the file that is commited in one commit
- DO NOT cancel its changes in the file system NOR delete it in the file system

## How
```
git reset --soft HEAD^
git reset HEAD <path/to/unwanted_file>
git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
```

# Track large files with Git LFS in all existing commits

## Purposes
- Track large files with Git LFS
- But have multiple existing commits that have not tracked the files

## How
```
git lfs migrate import --include="*.<extension_of_the_file_you_want_to_track>"
# following optional, but better because it clean up the repo immediately 
git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all
git gc --prune=now
```

# Clone only a certain branch of a remote repo
## Purposes
- Clone a repo
- But only clone a specific branch (maybe to reduce downloading time) 

## How
```
git clone -b <branch_name> --single-branch <repo_url> 
```

# Update all submodules to latest commit
## How
```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
